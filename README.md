The Responsive Parallax website with HTML5 and CSS3 uses a fixed background image with CSS to give the parallax scrolling effect as website visitors navigate through the website.  This website includes a jQuery menu that will have a single-column drop down effect when the website sizes down to the tablet type device withs such as the iPad.  Also in the website is an image slider using a jQuery plugin called the “BX-Slider”.
